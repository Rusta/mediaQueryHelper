mediaQueryHelper
============================

Handy little plugin that displays viewport width and height in a discreet draggable div on the page, that updates on window resize. 

I built it to help me find and test breakpoints when trying to create media queries for responsive design

## Demo

Features:

- Displays current height and width of window
- Discreet semi-transparent div that can be dragged to any part of the page (touch to drag coming soon)
- no jQuery dependencies, just plug the code in and you are away 
- seems to work in Chrome, Safari, Firefox, IE10 and iOS
